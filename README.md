### Hello!

I'm Ava, but you can also call me ducky!

I program primarily in Python

I'm still trying to figure out Rust

Currently, I'm really only programming for fun. Primarily to just make my life a bit easier and to make people laugh a little. So public repos that you'll see here will just mainly be joke programs and the rare utilities that I'm proud enough to make public lol

oh and im still hugging my blahaj :3
